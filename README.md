# PRIVACY POLICY

**PRIVACY POLICY EXPECTATIONS**

We expect that a basic privacy policy would at minimum include the following:

1) What data do you collect, including but not limited to personal identifying information?

2) Why do you need the data?

4) Other than Discord the company and users of your own bot on Discord the platform, who do you share your collected data with, if anyone?

5) How can users contact you if they have concerns about your bot?

6) If you store data, how can users have that data removed?

We store IDs of The users and servers who interact with certain features of the bot such as configuring the commands.

The above data is stored for configuration purposes, for ex:- server-specific prefixes, Users’ IDs are used to associate their account with our system in the bot’s database.

We dont share data to others

Users can contact us by joining our support server

Data is stored for an unlimited, however, the data will be deleted at the discretion of the user/s. The database will also be cleaned out or rested to remove old or irrelevant values as often as once a month – 2 months.

We do not have any specific expectations with regard to how you make your privacy policy available. We simply expect that you do your best to make it available to your users however you see fit. This can be a link to a website, a command in your bot, a link to a Pastebin, the option for users to request it via DM, or pretty much anything that empowers users to go find your policy if they should want it.

Will this cover every legal obligation you may or may not have as a software developer working with user information at scale? We can’t really speak to this, and if you are concerned about your legal obligations regarding GDPR, CCPA, and other regional data regulations, we would advise speaking with a lawyer. Would this cover our expectations for you as a user of our API? Yes.
